Sub-team (current): Components
Main task (current): Tail
Spend at least 15 minutes per week filling out this form.

Activities
Progress
What have I achieved this week?
General
Investigated how a parameterized design can be made in fusion around an exact airfoil
Completed tasks

Problems
What problems am I encountering?
General
Fusion is not always awesome… (+I need to practice more)
Not knowing how we want to manufacture the tail
Specific tasks
Making a 2nd CAD tail design based on the same principles as last years drone so we have something to build upon if we decide to go that route

Main task (current): Manager for tail
Spend at least 15 minutes per week filling out this form.

Activities
Progress
What have I achieved this week?
General
Performed specific stiffness material analysis
Attempted to tackle backlog of subgroup progress report
Completed tasks
Performed initial analysis on material specific stiffness, comparing the considered alternatives.
Aluminium and plywood have a similar performance, choose based on availability and desired shape of components.
Problems
What problems am I encountering?
General
Lack of time due to exams, inability to meet with group.
Specific tasks
None
Plans
What’s your plan moving forward?
General
Start cadding up concepts (moved from last week)
Keep coordinating the subgroups (extra difficult without being there)

Specific tasks
Create rough CAD concept of fuselage structure + Outer shell (moved from last week)
Perform initial load simulation in Ansys (moved from last week)

Activities
Progress
What have I achieved this week?
General
Got GKN to donate old pre-preg carbon fiber, which will meet all carbon needs this year.
Progress made on wing layup calculations - the python script now shows you deflections due to bending in lift.
