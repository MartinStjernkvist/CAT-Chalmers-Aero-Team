# Individual Plans - Week 45

## [00] Adam P | Systems & simulations

Keep on working with XLFR5

---

## [01] Alexander B | Systems & simulations

To finish up the design of the tail and eventually simulate it in Xflr5 to get results on its stability.

-

---

## [03] Felix A | Components

I will try to attend the workshops as much as I can, it is a bit unfortunate that the ordinary workshops are on Thursdays since I have boxing training then.

---

## [04] Gustav T | Components

Write down the plan for the rib/spar design and see if I can split the work between me and the other tail-guys

---

## [05] Gustav Wikström | Testbed and Avionics/Electronics

Help the testbed team with electronics and make the plane flyable

---

## [06] Hugo Modin Asklid | PR & Org

Send out sponsorship letters.
Order t-shirts.
Recruit new PR members.
Progress update and UAS challenge posts.

---

## [07] Jakob B | Components

Improving CAD models of wing to include control surfaces, going to need information from systems and simulations on the control surfaces and avionics on what servo is going to be used.
If time allows, to learn more about carbon fiber from manufacturing, to simulate more accurately. Raaed has a script he can send that I want to look into.

Model control surfaces.
Learn more about carbon fiber.

---

## [08] Johan S | Manufacturing

Complete allergenic compounds safety tour

Get experience with FUSE 3D printers.
Check with FUSE-staff about using higher thermograde plastics in their machines.

---

## [09] Marcin Kryger | Components

Tidy up the CAD and start placing things in there properly
Guide team members within the CAD work

Redo design of internal fuselage structure, different approach
Introduce the global coordinate system proposed by Martin

---

## [11] Noa S | Avionics and electronics

Continue studying aircraft design and avionics.

Continue working on the report

---

## [12] Paula E | Systems and simulations

Write the report for the deadline on friday

---

## [13] Prasshanth V | Components

To optimize the structure

---

## [14] Raaed K | Manufacturing

Figure out the development of the script to include torsion, and stress calculations along with the deflection calculations

---

## [15] Raphael V | Components

Wk 46:
Refine wing simulation for database
Help with wing manufacturing
Studies for endplate
Reports for performance and Stability to validate Avionics and Systems
Suport the members with Tail and Wing Cad

---

## [16] Victor P | Components - Tail

Redo the models and assembly but in a more structured way. Additionally, refine the design based on team feedback and consider manufacturing possibilities more closely when designing. 

Organize my model better and take manufacturing limitations more seriously.

---

## [17] Wiggo N | Components

Will have to take a step back during next week due to other school projects. Will attend all meetings and workshops and try to get as much done as i can then.

---

## [18] Yusuf M | Manufacturing methods

Get access to composites lab

Start looking to how to manufacture wooden i beams
Research on methods to manufacture cfrp i beams

---
