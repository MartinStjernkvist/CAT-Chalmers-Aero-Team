# Individual Plans - Week 45

## [00] Adam P | Systems & simulations

Keep on working with XLFR5

---

## [01] Alexander B | Systems & simulations

To finish up the design of the tail and eventually simulate it in Xflr5 to get results on its stability.

-

---

## [03] Jakob B | Components

Improving CAD models of wing to include control surfaces, going to need information from systems and simulations on the control surfaces and avionics on what servo is going to be used.
If time allows, to learn more about carbon fiber from manufacturing, to simulate more accurately. Raaed has a script he can send that I want to look into.

Model control surfaces.
Learn more about carbon fiber.

## [04] Johan S | Manufacturing

Complete allergenic compounds safety tour

Get experience with FUSE 3D printers.
Check with FUSE-staff about using higher thermograde plastics in their machines.

---

## [05] Marcin Kryger | Components

Tidy up the CAD and start placing things in there properly
Guide team members within the CAD work

Redo design of internal fuselage structure, different approach
Introduce the global coordinate system proposed by Martin

---

## [06] Martin Stjernkvist | -

Report writing
Create the project plan.

---

## [07] Paula E | Systems and simulations

Write the report for the deadline on friday

---

## [08] Prasshanth V | Components

To optimize the structure

---

## [10] Victor P | Components - Tail

Redo the models and assembly but in a more structured way. Additionally, refine the design based on team feedback and consider manufacturing possibilities more closely when designing. 

Organize my model better and take manufacturing limitations more seriously.
