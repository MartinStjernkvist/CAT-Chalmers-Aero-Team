Individual Progress Report
Sub-team (current): 
Systems & simulations
Main task (current): 
Determine dimensions for the control surfaces and wings.

Activities
Progress
What have I achieved this week?
General

Completed tasks
Decided on high wing configuration and horizontal stabilizers with offset=0 and made progress with the control surfaces. Also flaps and slats are ruled out for this iteration since it's too complicated.
Problems
What problems am I encountering?
General
Since the efficiency loss by having stabs and main wing at the same height is about 30% we should probably scale the tail accordingly.
Specific tasks

Plans
What’s your plan moving forward?
General
Keep on working with XLFR5

IPR [Jakob Bridle] W45
Individual Progress Report
Sub-team (current): Components
Main task (current): Wings - Structural


Activities
Progress
What have I achieved this week?
General
More work on the CAD model, particularly working more on the sizing for the spar. Looking at what aluminium tubes XP and Fuse has, that we can use as molds for a carbon-fiber spar. Done simple structural analysis in ansys for the wing assembly, to get a feeling for locations of high stress and deflection.
Went to GKN to get materials.
Completed tasks
Iterate CAD model.
Simple structural analysis of wing assembly. 
Drove to get materials. 
Problems
What problems am I encountering?
General
Had some problems in ansys with my model. Need more information on the new material (Material data sheet) to better model material behaviour under loads.
Specific tasks
Simple structural analysis of wing assembly.
Plans
What’s your plan moving forward?
General
Improving CAD models of wing to include control surfaces, going to need information from systems and simulations on the control surfaces and avionics on what servo is going to be used.
If time allows, to learn more about carbon fiber from manufacturing, to simulate more accurately. Raaed has a script he can send that I want to look into.
Specific tasks
Model control surfaces.
Learn more about carbon fiber.

Lessons learnt
Split body in Ansys instead of in fusion 360, the split body in fusion wont be in ansys so it needs to be done in spaceclaim.

Individual Progress Report
Sub-team (current): Manufacturing
Main task (current): 3D printed molds
Spend at least 15 minutes per week filling out this form.

Activities
Progress
What have I achieved this week?
General
Investigate feasibility of 3D printed molds for carbon fibre pre-preg.
Completed tasks
FUSE - rapid prototyping course

Problems
What problems am I encountering?
General
Hard to get an overview of the available tools and all the prerequisites.
Specific tasks
Dimensions of the 3D printers are a limiting factor, requiring assembly of smaller molds if the part is large.
Prepreg requires curing at around 100 degrees celsius, which will deform commonly used plastics.

Plans
What’s your plan moving forward?
General
Complete allergenic compounds safety tour
Specific tasks
Get experience with FUSE 3D printers.
Check with FUSE-staff about using higher thermograde plastics in their machines.

## [07] Paula E

**Sub-team:** Systems and simulations  
**Main Task:** Finalizing the dimensioning of tail wing  

IPR Paula Eriksson W45
Individual Progress Report
Sub-team (current): 
Systems and simulations
Main task (current): 
Finalizing the dimensioning of tail wing 
Spend at least 15 minutes per week filling out this form.

Activities
Progress
What have I achieved this week?
General

Completed tasks
-Sizing of control surfaces for the tail wing (30% if the cord for V1)
	30% of chord—>0.04m for the V1
For V2 it ca be increase if we need more maneuverability.
Decrease in more stability 

-Determinant height of the tail wing relative to main wing (will ba an offset of 0 for V1)
Place the tail wing in line with the main wings. When the tail is in line with the wing, the airflow behind the wing is smooth and predictable, which helps the aircraft stay stable in pitch. This makes it easier to control and trim during flight.
Structurally, this setup is also lighter and easier to build. The tail can attach directly to the fuselage boom without a tall fin or extra support, saving weight and reducing drag. Although the tail may work in slightly disturbed air from the main wing, this effect is usually small and easy to adjust for.
-No flaps and slats for now 
Problems
What problems am I encountering?
General
Need information from Gustavo but since he was away we had to work around this
Lack of dedication and motivation in the team (only me and Adam was at the workshop)

## [10] Victor P

**Sub-team:** Components - Tail  
**Main Task:** Fully parameterize prototype CAD model

Individual Progress Report
Sub-team (current): Components - Tail
Main task (current): Fully parameterize prototype CAD model
Spend at least 15 minutes per week filling out this form.

Activities
Progress
What have I achieved this week?
General
I have made semi-parameterized models and an assembly for the tailbox, horizontal and vertical airfoils. 
Completed tasks
Completed an early concept for the airfoils and tailbox. 
Problems
What problems am I encountering?
General
Fully parameterizing the models is proving to be a bit difficult. I’ve managed to create a “paranormal parameter” which isn’t used anywhere but cannot be deleted since it’s used in ‘’. I have also gotten some of the measurements tangled so things no longer behave the way I want them. 
Specific tasks
Fully parameterize the model and keep track of parameters. 
Plans
What’s your plan moving forward?
General
Redo the models and assembly but in a more structured way. Additionally, refine the design based on team feedback and consider manufacturing possibilities more closely when designing. 
Specific tasks
Organize my model better and take manufacturing limitations more seriously.
