**Main Task:** Determine dimensions for the control surfaces and wings.  

W45
IPR [Adam Persson] W45
Individual Progress Report
Sub-team (current): 
Systems & simulations
Main task (current): 
Determine dimensions for the control surfaces and wings.

Activities
Progress
What have I achieved this week?
General

Completed tasks
Decided on high wing configuration and horizontal stabilizers with offset=0 and made progress with the control surfaces. Also flaps and slats are ruled out for this iteration since it's too complicated.
Problems
What problems am I encountering?
General
Since the efficiency loss by having stabs and main wing at the same height is about 30% we should probably scale the tail accordingly.
Specific tasks

Plans
What’s your plan moving forward?
General
Keep on working with XLFR5

## [12] Paula E

**Main Task:** Finalizing the dimensioning of tail wing

Systems and simulations
Main task (current): 
Finalizing the dimensioning of tail wing 
Spend at least 15 minutes per week filling out this form.

Activities
Progress
What have I achieved this week?
General

Completed tasks
-Sizing of control surfaces for the tail wing (30% if the cord for V1)
	30% of chord—>0.04m for the V1
For V2 it ca be increase if we need more maneuverability.
Decrease in more stability 

-Determinant height of the tail wing relative to main wing (will ba an offset of 0 for V1)
Place the tail wing in line with the main wings. When the tail is in line with the wing, the airflow behind the wing is smooth and predictable, which helps the aircraft stay stable in pitch. This makes it easier to control and trim during flight.
Structurally, this setup is also lighter and easier to build. The tail can attach directly to the fuselage boom without a tall fin or extra support, saving weight and reducing drag. Although the tail may work in slightly disturbed air from the main wing, this effect is usually small and easy to adjust for.
-No flaps and slats for now 
Problems
What problems am I encountering?
General
Need information from Gustavo but since he was away we had to work around this
Lack of dedication and motivation in the team (only me and Adam was at the workshop)

Main task (current): Fully parameterize prototype CAD model
Spend at least 15 minutes per week filling out this form.

Activities
Progress
What have I achieved this week?
General
I have made semi-parameterized models and an assembly for the tailbox, horizontal and vertical airfoils. 
Completed tasks
Completed an early concept for the airfoils and tailbox. 
Problems
What problems am I encountering?
General
Fully parameterizing the models is proving to be a bit difficult. I’ve managed to create a “paranormal parameter” which isn’t used anywhere but cannot be deleted since it’s used in ‘’. I have also gotten some of the measurements tangled so things no longer behave the way I want them. 
Specific tasks
Fully parameterize the model and keep track of parameters. 
Plans
What’s your plan moving forward?
General
Redo the models and assembly but in a more structured way. Additionally, refine the design based on team feedback and consider manufacturing possibilities more closely when designing. 
Specific tasks
Organize my model better and take manufacturing limitations more seriously.

Sub-team (current): Components
Main task (current): Design of floor and rear landing gear


Activities
Progress
General
Measured battery to create a placeholder model in CAD. Measured the current complete assembly to get an idea of the dimensions that will be used later. Helped to create a placeholder for the water container. Talked with manufacturing of how a simple rear landing gear should be constructed, the current design should be revised
Completed tasks
Made an incredibly simple floor design so it can be put in the complete assembly to see what space we are working with.   
Problems
General
I have a lot of other school projects that take a lot of time and energy at the moment so haven’t been able to give that much effort into the tasks I have taken on.
Specific tasks
Haven’t had time to produce a Rear landing gear V2 that was talked about during the workshop on Wednesday. Informed Marcin (on saturday) about having to complete it during our monday meeting instead. 
Plans
General
Will have to take a step back during next week due to other school projects. Will attend all meetings and workshops and try to get as much done as i can then.
