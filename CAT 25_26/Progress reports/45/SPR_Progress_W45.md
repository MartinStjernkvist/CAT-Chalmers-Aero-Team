# Sub-team Progress - Week 45

## AVIONICS & ELECTRONICS

Work on the report has been done. Plans for the electrical schematics have been started and the final component list will be done soon

## COMPONENTS

Design of bulkhead
Design of side panels
Design of floor
Stand-in for payload and battery
CAD-design of wing
Initial material info from manufacturing
Initial structural analysis of wing

We got some awesome material from GKN

## MANUFACTURING METHODS

We have people with access to the complete wood workshop at FUSE
Easy Composites Order in Progress
Oracover wrapping tested on an old wing frame

## SYSTEM & SIMULATIONS

Determined the control surface areas for the tail wing: 30% for V1 (0.04m). Might be increased or decreased for V3 depending on performance.
Decided to not have flaps and slats for V1 since it’s too complicated as of now 
Decided to place the tail wings at the same height as the main wings. Pros and cons with this:
+simpler to manufacture 
+drones form previous years seems to have done this so it should work fine
-the tail wing will be placed in a disturbed airflow causing the effectiveness of the tail wing to decrease (about 30%)  but this could be partially compensated for by increasing the size of the tail wings.
