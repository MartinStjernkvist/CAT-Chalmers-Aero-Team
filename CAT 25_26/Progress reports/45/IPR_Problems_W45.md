# Individual Problems - Week 45

## [00] Adam P | Systems & simulations

Since the efficiency loss by having stabs and main wing at the same height is about 30% we should probably scale the tail accordingly.

---

## [01] Alexander B | Systems & simulations

No problems.

## [02] André A

Very hard to understand how the formulas for flight are working.

---

## [03] Felix A | Components

I have not been really sure what our tasks have been, but Gustav has helped out to structure the work.

I am not going to have that much time to spare this study period since I am taking courses at GU and have started the truck driving education I talked about in September. Me and Todd are also having two Expfys labs this study period.

## [04] Gustav T | Components

I struggle to build what I want in Fusion. Fusion doesn’t seem to detect edges properly. (I have not really seen this problem in other CAD software.
I also have a lot going on in my courses right now so I can’t really find enough time the coming week.

## [05] Gustav Wikström | Testbed and Avionics/Electronics

Not the fastest communication with the testbed team

---

## [06] Hugo Modin Asklid | PR & Org

A little lack of time in general

---

## [07] Jakob B | Components

Had some problems in ansys with my model. Need more information on the new material (Material data sheet) to better model material behaviour under loads.

Simple structural analysis of wing assembly.

---

## [08] Johan S | Manufacturing

Hard to get an overview of the available tools and all the prerequisites.

Dimensions of the 3D printers are a limiting factor, requiring assembly of smaller molds if the part is large.
Prepreg requires curing at around 100 degrees celsius, which will deform commonly used plastics.

## [09] Marcin Kryger | Components

CAD chaos

Navigating the usage of parameters and coordinate systems in the design

---

## [10] Martin Stjernkvist | -

Team engagement

---

## [11] Noa S | Avionics and electronics

-

-

---

## [12] Paula E | Systems and simulations

Need information from Gustavo but since he was away we had to work around this
Lack of dedication and motivation in the team (only me and Adam was at the workshop)

---

## [14] Raaed K | Manufacturing

Skill issue - Still wrapping my head around the problem of torsion in composite beams. Slowing down script development

---

## [16] Victor P | Components - Tail

Fully parameterizing the models is proving to be a bit difficult. I’ve managed to create a “paranormal parameter” which isn’t used anywhere but cannot be deleted since it’s used in ‘’. I have also gotten some of the measurements tangled so things no longer behave the way I want them. 

Fully parameterize the model and keep track of parameters.

---

## [17] Wiggo N | Components

I have a lot of other school projects that take a lot of time and energy at the moment so haven’t been able to give that much effort into the tasks I have taken on.

Haven’t had time to produce a Rear landing gear V2 that was talked about during the workshop on Wednesday. Informed Marcin (on saturday) about having to complete it during our monday meeting instead.

## [18] Yusuf M | Manufacturing methods

No access to composites lab yet which means a can’t begin with cfrp work yet in mt task
No access to a metal workshop
