# Individual Problems - Week 45

## [00] Adam P | Systems & simulations

Since the efficiency loss by having stabs and main wing at the same height is about 30% we should probably scale the tail accordingly.

## [01] Alexander B | Systems & simulations

No problems.

## [02] André A

Very hard to understand how the formulas for flight are working.

---

## [03] Jakob B | Components

Had some problems in ansys with my model. Need more information on the new material (Material data sheet) to better model material behaviour under loads.

Simple structural analysis of wing assembly.

---

## [04] Johan S | Manufacturing

Hard to get an overview of the available tools and all the prerequisites.

Dimensions of the 3D printers are a limiting factor, requiring assembly of smaller molds if the part is large.
Prepreg requires curing at around 100 degrees celsius, which will deform commonly used plastics.

## [05] Marcin Kryger | Components

CAD chaos

Navigating the usage of parameters and coordinate systems in the design

---

## [07] Paula E | Systems and simulations

Need information from Gustavo but since he was away we had to work around this
Lack of dedication and motivation in the team (only me and Adam was at the workshop)

## [10] Victor P | Components - Tail

Fully parameterizing the models is proving to be a bit difficult. I’ve managed to create a “paranormal parameter” which isn’t used anywhere but cannot be deleted since it’s used in ‘’. I have also gotten some of the measurements tangled so things no longer behave the way I want them. 

Fully parameterize the model and keep track of parameters.
