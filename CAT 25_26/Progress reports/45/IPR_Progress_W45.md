# Individual Progress - Week 45

## [00] Adam P | Systems & simulations

Decided on high wing configuration and horizontal stabilizers with offset=0 and made progress with the control surfaces. Also flaps and slats are ruled out for this iteration since it's too complicated.

## [01] Alexander B | Systems & simulations

I have been sick for most of the week, however I attended the sub-group meeting on Monday and had a chat with the sub-team for the upcoming all-group meeting on Tuesday. I also spoke privately with a team member about design strategies on Thursday before the workshop I couldn’t attend.

## [02] André A

More modular mission script, redoing of basic structure, change into 2D instead of error-prone 3D.

## [03] Jakob B | Components

More work on the CAD model, particularly working more on the sizing for the spar. Looking at what aluminium tubes XP and Fuse has, that we can use as molds for a carbon-fiber spar. Done simple structural analysis in ansys for the wing assembly, to get a feeling for locations of high stress and deflection.
Went to GKN to get materials.

Iterate CAD model.
Simple structural analysis of wing assembly. 
Drove to get materials.

## [07] Paula E | Systems and simulations

-Sizing of control surfaces for the tail wing (30% if the cord for V1)
	30% of chord—>0.04m for the V1
For V2 it ca be increase if we need more maneuverability.
Decrease in more stability 

-Determinant height of the tail wing relative to main wing (will ba an offset of 0 for V1)
Place the tail wing in line with the main wings. When the tail is in line with the wing, the airflow behind the wing is smooth and predictable, which helps the aircraft stay stable in pitch. This makes it easier to control and trim during flight.
Structurally, this setup is also lighter and easier to build. The tail can attach directly to the fuselage boom without a tall fin or extra support, saving weight and reducing drag. Although the tail may work in slightly disturbed air from the main wing, this effect is usually small and easy to adjust for.
-No flaps and slats for now

## [08] Prasshanth V | Components

CAD model of the internal structure of the wings and a basic structural analysis.

## [10] Victor P | Components - Tail

I have made semi-parameterized models and an assembly for the tailbox, horizontal and vertical airfoils. 

Completed an early concept for the airfoils and tailbox.
