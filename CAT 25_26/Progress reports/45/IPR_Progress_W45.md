# Individual Progress - Week 45

## [00] Adam P | Systems & simulations

Decided on high wing configuration and horizontal stabilizers with offset=0 and made progress with the control surfaces. Also flaps and slats are ruled out for this iteration since it's too complicated.

## [01] Alexander B | Systems & simulations

I have been sick for most of the week, however I attended the sub-group meeting on Monday and had a chat with the sub-team for the upcoming all-group meeting on Tuesday. I also spoke privately with a team member about design strategies on Thursday before the workshop I couldn’t attend.

## [02] André A

More modular mission script, redoing of basic structure, change into 2D instead of error-prone 3D.

---

## [03] Felix A | Components

I have been learning Fusion, but I am still on a beginners level, and was also able to attend the workshop on Wednesday.

---

## [04] Gustav T | Components

Specified what goes into designing the second version of the tail (carbon spar + ribs)
Started doing a proper CAD model

---

## [05] Gustav Wikström | Testbed and Avionics/Electronics

Been sick most of the week, but have been able to get in contact with test bed and suggested a time to meet and talk about the situation thus far.

## [06] Hugo Modin Asklid | PR & Org

Email conversation regarding t-shirt print offer from Teknologtryck.
Poster for recruiting new PR members.

Merch print job done and ready to be fetched (thursday lunch w46).

## [07] Jakob B | Components

More work on the CAD model, particularly working more on the sizing for the spar. Looking at what aluminium tubes XP and Fuse has, that we can use as molds for a carbon-fiber spar. Done simple structural analysis in ansys for the wing assembly, to get a feeling for locations of high stress and deflection.
Went to GKN to get materials.

Iterate CAD model.
Simple structural analysis of wing assembly. 
Drove to get materials.

## [11] Noa S | Avionics and electronics

I have gotten more familiar with the team and our goals. Studied drones and aircraft design

Not fully completed, but started working on the report and a schematic of the drone and its circuits

## [12] Paula E | Systems and simulations

-Sizing of control surfaces for the tail wing (30% if the cord for V1)
	30% of chord—>0.04m for the V1
For V2 it ca be increase if we need more maneuverability.
Decrease in more stability 

-Determinant height of the tail wing relative to main wing (will ba an offset of 0 for V1)
Place the tail wing in line with the main wings. When the tail is in line with the wing, the airflow behind the wing is smooth and predictable, which helps the aircraft stay stable in pitch. This makes it easier to control and trim during flight.
Structurally, this setup is also lighter and easier to build. The tail can attach directly to the fuselage boom without a tall fin or extra support, saving weight and reducing drag. Although the tail may work in slightly disturbed air from the main wing, this effect is usually small and easy to adjust for.
-No flaps and slats for now

## [13] Prasshanth V | Components

CAD model of the internal structure of the wings and a basic structural analysis.

---

## [14] Raaed K | Manufacturing

Got the pre-preg from GKN Aerospace.
Handed out tasks to members in the group.
Tried out wrapping wings with oracover.

---

## [15] Raphael V | Components

Wk 45:
Conceptual design for tail and wing done

---

## [16] Victor P | Components - Tail

I have made semi-parameterized models and an assembly for the tailbox, horizontal and vertical airfoils. 

Completed an early concept for the airfoils and tailbox.

---

## [17] Wiggo N | Components

Measured battery to create a placeholder model in CAD. Measured the current complete assembly to get an idea of the dimensions that will be used later. Helped to create a placeholder for the water container. Talked with manufacturing of how a simple rear landing gear should be constructed, the current design should be revised

Made an incredibly simple floor design so it can be put in the complete assembly to see what space we are working with.

Completed rapid prototyping course 
Got assigned my first task
