Activities
Progress
What has the sub-team achieved this week?
General
Determined the control surface areas for the tail wing: 30% for V1 (0.04m). Might be increased or decreased for V3 depending on performance.
Decided to not have flaps and slats for V1 since it’s too complicated as of now 
Decided to place the tail wings at the same height as the main wings. Pros and cons with this:
+simpler to manufacture 
+drones form previous years seems to have done this so it should work fine
-the tail wing will be placed in a disturbed airflow causing the effectiveness of the tail wing to decrease (about 30%)  but this could be partially compensated for by increasing the size of the tail wings. 
Completed tasks
Tail wing placement
Control surfaces of tail wing

Problems
What problems are we encountering?
General
A lot of members were absent last week which made it harder to get work done. Hopefully this won't be a problem the coming week. 
We will have a lot to do this week due to the approaching deadline so time management and willingness to work will be important. 
Specific tasks

Plans
What’s the plan moving forward?
General 
The main focus will be to write the report for the deadline on Friday. 
New tasks
Decide CG placement 
Complete document with measurement of V1
Write report
Prepare presentation
