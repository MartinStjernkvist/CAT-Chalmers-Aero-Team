CAT Handbook
Document team activities and team structure in a handbook
One document in the style of a thesis should be easier to read than multiple smaller documents
Nice to have information assembled and in order for new team members that join

Targeted recruiting - PR & Organization
Need additional members on the PR & Organization sub-team tasks, understaffed at the moment
It would be good to hand over material
