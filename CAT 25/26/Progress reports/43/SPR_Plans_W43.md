# Sub-team Plans - Week 43

## COMPONENTS

Start forming rough concepts in the CAD
Begin designing internal structures

New tasks
Wing: We need takeoff values for velocity and angle of attack to optimize the wing
Wing: Internal structure of the wing
Tail: size of control surfaces
Ask about waterjet, ability to cut carbon fibre - maybe outsource it
Coordinate with systems about control surface design
Put monocoque on hold for fuselage, work on separate internal structure
Investigate vacuum forming
Investigate building a spar integrated into the wing design (single component)
Start making some rough CAD concepts
