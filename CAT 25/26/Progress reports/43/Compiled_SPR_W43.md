Compile information from the Individual Progress Reports (IPR).
Material for the General Lunch Meetings.

Activities
Progress
What has the sub-team achieved this week?
General
Coordinated with other subgroups
More proactive meetings, joint progress
Completed tasks
Wing: lift and drag calculations for the wing (concept design done for the wing S1223)
Tail: Parameters for the tail
General: Material selection/analysis performed with help of Materials (4th edition) and granta
Talked about just launching a dummy weight in V1
Meetings with manufacturing to coordinate a manufacturable design
Investigated landing gear configurations, discussing ease of landing and stability. ⇒ Tricycle as landing and take-off should be easier without tipping forward and mowing the lawn. Also looked at camber and toe configuration, discussed wheel size.
Problems
What problems are we encountering?
General
Clearing up some manufacturability concerns
Gathering reliable data
Specific tasks
Getting good information for material selection in the structural parts
Plans
What’s the plan moving forward?
General 
Start forming rough concepts in the CAD
Begin designing internal structures

New tasks
Wing: We need takeoff values for velocity and angle of attack to optimize the wing
Wing: Internal structure of the wing
Tail: size of control surfaces
Ask about waterjet, ability to cut carbon fibre - maybe outsource it
Coordinate with systems about control surface design
Put monocoque on hold for fuselage, work on separate internal structure
Investigate vacuum forming
Investigate building a spar integrated into the wing design (single component)
Start making some rough CAD concepts
